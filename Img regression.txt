1) Mask JUST the body part. Anything else.
	- Original filling method
	- CROP AND RESIZE!! IMPORTANT!!!
        - Just the part of the body to inpaint
		- CFG Scale: 11
		- fill method
		- Euler
		- DS 0.75

- Send to inpaint again
	- Mask borders, with 5px or 10px more (correcting)
		- Previous result seed
		- "Only Masked" inpaint area
		- "32" only masked padding pixels
		- 0.65 Denoising Strength
		- 35 sampling steps.
		- "Original" masked content
		- 6 mask blur

- Send result to inpaint
		- Bigger mask
		- "Only masked" inpaint area
		- +2 Mask blur
		- -0.10 DS
		- -5 sampling steps
	- x3 times?

- Last time just fill the mask and do it again, with the last settings.
	- Should have 0.45 DS.
	- Corrects weird things.

- FINAL: Entire body (except face) mask
	- Denoising strenght 0.05
		- -0.01 each time
		- min 0.01.
	- Mask blur 12
	- original masked content
	- 20 sampling steps
	- +3 CFG Scale each time.
		- Max 20.
	- +x4 times

TIPS:
	- 0.30 DS can remove small things like pieces of bra or broken clothes, remains of clothes.

- Save each iteration result.
	- Show all images in parallel side by side meanwhile every iteration is running.
	- Let user choice desired images in UI.
- Let user remove the Interrogation tags that represents the OPPOSITE of what they want
	- Show them in a UI and let user remove and add positive and negative tags!
- OR let user decide which parts to improve?
